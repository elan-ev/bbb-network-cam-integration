How can users provide the video conference room?
    The variable ROOMNAME in the start_stream.sh script can be changed to any room name that belongs (or should be created) under the current user.
    Alternatively, it could be implemented that ROOMNAME can be set to a link of a room that should be joined.
    The ROOMNAME variable in the script can also easily be made an input parameter of the script.

How can users provide the network camera stream?
    For this, the variable RTSP_STREAM can be used. An RTMP stream can be used here as well, although this still needs to be tested.

What potential authentication mechanisms do we need?
    In the prototype, we need an account for BBB. The username is set in the start_stream.sh script (USERNAME).
    The password is then prompted during the script.
    For starting the script, root access is also needed (for adding the v4l2loopback module to the kernel), but this is (obviously) also handled by the script.

Can we create a simple user interface for this?
    A simple UI could be imagined, where the user can set parameters like the RTSP/RTMP stream address, the room name, the username and maybe even the password.
    These parameters could then be passed to the start_stream.sh script (instead of setting them in the script).

Can we schedule start/stop?
    A simple way to schedule start would be to add a crontab job for each start point.
    For stopping, timeout might be used for specifying how long the program should run.
